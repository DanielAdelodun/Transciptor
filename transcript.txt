There will be real time, interactive practical sessions every week. We do not now yet whether they will be online, or whether some of them will be on campus. That will depend on government advice at the time. It is likely that some students will be on campus at some stage, while certainly not all will be. But online or in person: there will definitely be small group, interactive teaching sessions.

Ohh...there will be many: For example we want to teach your programming, that you can make computers do what you want them to do. But you will also hear about the science and theory behind CS...this will range from good software engineering to the Halting problem. But it is really hard to pin even the most important concepts in just one chat.

Response:
You can enrol in the course with a Year In Industry from the beginning, or you can change into it later. However, enrolling in it from the beginning if you are interested is easier, since changing out of it (going from four to three years) is easier than the other way around. If you decide to go from three to four years later, you will need to adjust student finance, and visa if you are international. So: if you think you might ant to go into industry for a year - which is a great thing to do - enrol in it from the beginning.

These are separate programmes. If you are not already in them, you can transfer up to the second year into them, given good grades in the first two years. Year in industry and year abroad will be in between the 2nd and 3rd year. You will need to find an internship or partner university, but we will help as much as we can. We have a dedicated person who liaises with partners (industry and unis) and we have a long track record in these programmes. So many companies come to use to fill these internships, for example..

There is some mathematics that you will need, but much of it is quite different from A Level Maths. It is a sort of 'Maths for computer science'. We teach this here, and you will have a maths module that you need to take. Of course, it always helps if you're good at Maths.

This depends on whether/when students can be on campus. But assuming that students are not on campus: there will be extensive induction events, social events, opportunity to chat to students – just all online, until we can be on campus. But we are working on making that all happen. And then you can have an in-person freshers week when we can all go back to campus.

Yes, some parts are quite theoretical, but it is not the kind of high-school math, but rather CS math. We will teach all the math that is required though. Overall, our modules have a good balance between theory and practice. With optional modules you can also choose whether you want to be closer to the theory end of the CS-spectrum, or more to the applied end. Does this help?

There is no recommendation. We provide PCs in College (of course only once buildings open again). For home, I recommend any hardware in the last 5 years should be more than sufficient. There might be specific modules where more power would be desirable. But there should be no show stopper if you do not have it. As said high-end PC are also provided by the College.

A year in industry placement is an excellent thing to do. Just about all students who come back from it say it's the best thing they've done. And they ALL get jobs. To do this, apply for the degree "with a Year in Industry". You then go out to work between your second and final year of study. We help you find a place!

Well, to begin with there is a higher emphasis on rule systems and logic, like you have rules for solving a planning problem and you have to look for possible solutions. The question might be: Is there a solution at all? This requires typically a kind of formal/mathy reasoning which is quite different from school math. Then there is math that is required for estimating running times of algorithms (like P vs NP). Then the math you need to make sure algorithms are correct. Does this help?

Write some code! Pick a project - any project - and write something. That's the best thing to get a head start. If you want it to be directly relevant, use Java. But any language will be a benefit.

I might have missed some comments above: Generally, it is according to your taste. If you like work placements (the option with-year-in-industry), then this is a very successful programme. Last year, 100% of the students on this programme had a job offer at the end of their study (not necessarily though at the company they had their internship with. Students on this programme have a dedicated person who helps with finding internship placements.

That is very hard to say. There is only one module (which is in the first year) that is explicitly about programming. But many other modules require you to learn and practice programming, even though it is not the main topic. For example, you may have a module about Operationg Systems, and you are expected to lean and use C++. Or you have web programming, and you learn and use PHP/Javascript. etc. There are elements of programming in many places, and it is hard to quantify.

You can email me on christian.urban@kcl.ac.uk and I can send you an *optional* reading list for our first year. But generally my advise would be learn about programming. Java is an obvious choice, but maybe "smaller" languages like Scala or C++ would be helpful too.

Our four-year MSci does not come with an option of year-abroad or year-in-industry. This is only for the BScs. In practice you can interrupt your MSci for one year and study abroad. But then it will indeed be 5 years. And the credits obtained abroad do not count towards your MSci degree at King's. Does this help?

Response:
In principle you can defer without re-application, but you should not.  The first year is particularly about foundations and programming, which is well-suited for online learning. So instead of wasting one year, students can easily and comfortably complete the material of the first year. If many students defer, then students who complete the first year next year, will be in a much smaller market for internships, for example, which are usually scheduled between first and second year. And also big tech companies like Facebook and Google have not ceased to hiring people. Does this help?
